The “diabetes.csv” dataset has historical data on individuals that eventually either developed diabetes or not. Diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin to break down the food that you eat. Without medication, diabetes can lead to damage to cells and vital organs and eventual death. In this problem, we want to predict whether a person is at risk of becoming diabetic based on the individual’s data. This information can then be used to begin preventative measures for the individual (example lifestyle change in diet and exercise). The features and label for the dataset are described below Features or independent Variables: Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration, 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function, a score based on genetic factor of a person (diabetes has a close relation to family history). Age: Age (years) Labels or Dependent Variable: Outcome: No Diabetes = 0, Diabetes=1
